# File Organizer

This is a simple Go script to organize files from a specified directory into separate folders based on their file types (images and videos). The script automatically creates folders (`images` and `videos`) in the current directory and moves the files accordingly.

## Features

- Supports `.jpg`, `.png`, and `.mp4` file formats.
- Automatically creates target directories (`images` and `videos`) if they don't exist.
- Handles errors during file operations gracefully
